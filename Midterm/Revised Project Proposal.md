# Revised Project Proposal 

### Introduction
The recent election has illuminated the intense polarity between many individuals in expressing their political stances. People’s intense passion over their views proved to be quite controversial and at times threatening to those with opposing perspectives. This is demonstrated strongly in open discourse about gun control, given that many have demonstrated their views in the streets and on social media. These public demonstrations take the form of strikes and online statements, but what can often be seen is the passion behind gun reform and the patriotism over the Second Amendment right to bear arms. It has not been uncommon to witness how individual’s political statements have taken the form of radical displays made possible due to guns. This brings us to our current research approach in exploring gun-related incidents during election years in two states that have varying gun regulations, and are historically blue or red. Through exploring population demographics, twitter sentiments, and gun incident rates in Illinois and Texas we aim to learn if the political environment instigates higher gun related incidents and what socioeconomic elements may simultaneously  contribute. Our guiding questions are (1) In what ways do Twitter sentiments and Twitter interactions during election years contribute to the magnitude of gun-related incidents in the US? (2) Is there an increase in gun incidents during election years? (3)How may socioeconomic status contribute?

### Importance
The topic of gun control is a topic of great significance seeing that there are many incidents involving this instrument that's sole function is to harm, but in some cases, it serves as a measure of protection. However, many gun related incidents have occurred by accident. This research project has zeroed in on how elections create a stir when it comes to the topic, and how this may correlate to an increase in gun-related accidents. Moreover, since people have a habit to take to social media their personal opinions and express their feelings, we want to explore the emotional state of people when discussing issues of gun control. Depending on how it is people are feeling can affect the way guns are viewed and whether individuals are encouraged to act beyond the online sphere. Take, for example, people who make a point to carry around their guns and make a show to those who threaten their rights to have them. Another example is what has occurred at Capitol Hill, and this display and use of firearms were strongly correlated to politics and the upset state of many people.

### Spatial Scope
Again, we aim to investigate within the United States, specifically in the states of Illinois and Texas. We selected these two because we are from these areas and are relatively far enough from each other to offer variance. Moreover, these two states have different levels of gun control strictness. Given that we are also looking into election years, we added the factor of either being consistently red or blue states.

### Data Sources
[US Gun Violence Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database?select=mass_shootings_2016.csv)

- Breaks down gun violence by magnitude, age group, and intentions
- Provides specific statistics by state, date, and city
- This dataset is owned by the Gun Violence Archive and can be accessed in its original form here.

[Illinois Income - Census data](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B19001&geo_ids=04000US17,01000US,050|04000US17&primary_geo_id=04000US17)

[Illinois Education Attainment - Census data](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B19001&geo_ids=04000US17,01000US,050|04000US17&primary_geo_id=04000US17)

- breakes down education levels of attainment for males and females
- offers this information only for counties in Illinois

[Texas Education Attainment - Census data](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B15002&geo_ids=04000US48,050|04000US48&primary_geo_id=04000US48)

- breakes down education levels of attainment for males and females
- offers this information only for counties in Texas


### Visualizations
The data sets have date/time and spatial data that can be used as comparative components to provide definitive answers to differences in gun-related incidents. The spatial data can be best explored by using map elements to track the concentration of gun violence incidents across the US. To supplement the mapping graphics we would apply a comparative element to show the magnitude of incidents during election years and off years. In terms of design, a heat map or Kepler map would be visually inviting to show concentration. The relationship of location to the incident can be used to explain other inquiries or correlations as to why there is a higher concentration. It is also essential to analyze the types of gun violence and their relationship to election years. A pie chart could be beneficial to show the different kinds of gun violence and their measure per year. Additionally, tracking trends over the span of multiple years and comparing those trends to different candidates moving in and out of office will produce data to relate back to social media platforms’ sentiments. A two-category histogram can also be used to compare the span of political events, over time, in Texas and Illinois, in which the width would vary according to gun violence magnitude. Overall the visualizations would illustrate trends in gun-related incidents over the span of the political calendars in the US.

###Roles
We are both conducting data curation, data visualizations, and write-ups. However, Stacy focuses primarily on Texas and Ainsleigh on Illinois.

## Conclusion
The insights we hope to gain from this research project is a better understanding of the appearance of election associated gun violence in the US and how varying gun restrictions by state affect the outcome. Looking at sentiments, like nationalism, and their association with gun related incidents will help us better understand why the trends change over time. Overall, understanding the nature of trends associated with gun related incidents will help us and others navigate possibilities of prevention and like solutions.
