### Concerns
Some of our minor concerns are whether our data visualizations are interesting enough, and we worry if our two selected states will vary enough from each other. However, what poses greater concern is we are too committed to including a sentiment analysis when not necessary, or if we are even able to compile a data set of tweets to begin with.
