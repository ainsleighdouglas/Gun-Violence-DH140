### Concerns

Minor concerns:
- Our data visualizations not being visually interesting
- Will the selected states vary enough from each other

Major concerns:
- Is us wanting a sentiment analysis going to strengthen our research or is it us trying really hard to incorporate it 
- How we will compile a dataset of tweets about guns in each state at given years
