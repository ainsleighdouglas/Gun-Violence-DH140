# Project Proposal

### Introduction
The recent election has illuminated the intense polarity between many individuals in expressing their political stances. People’s intense passion over their views proved to be quite controversial and at times threatening to those with opposing perspectives. This is demonstrated strongly when in a discussion of gun control because many have taken it to the streets and social media. These public demonstrations take the form of strikes and online statements, but what can often be seen is the passion behind gun reform and the patriotism over the Second Amendment right to bear arms. It has not been uncommon to witness how individual’s political statements have taken the form of radical displays made possible due to guns. This brings us to our current research approach in exploring gun-related incidents during election years, which constantly revive the discussion of gun regulations, and also explore citizen sentiments on the issue. Moreover, rather than just exploring election season in the United States, we have taken to exploring within another developed country the UK.

### Importance
The topic of gun control is a topic of great significance seeing that there are many incidents involving this instrument that's sole function is to harm, but in some cases, it serves as a measure of protection. Regardless, such a potentially lethal weapon has often been used by individuals to break laws, murder people, and conduct political statements. This research project has zeroed in on how elections create a stir when it comes to the topic, and how this may correlate to an increase in gun-related crimes. Moreover, since people have a habit to take to social media their personal opinions and express their feelings, we want to explore the emotional state of people when discussing issues of gun control. Depending on how it is people are feeling can affect the way guns are viewed and whether individuals are encouraged to act beyond the online sphere. Take, for example, people who make a point to carry around their guns and make a show to those who threaten their rights to have them. Another example is what has occurred at capitol hill, and this display and use of firearms were strongly correlated to politics and the upset state of many people.

### Spatial Scope
Again, we aim to investigate within the United States and the United Kingdom to explore whether gun incidents are higher around recent election years and if individual's sentiments demonstrate a polarity on the issue online. These two locations also offer us the ability to compare two country’s election season gun incidents and discern new information, or maybe even patterns, about the time, areas, and social media sentiments

### Data Sources
[US Gun Violence Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database?select=mass_shootings_2016.csv)

- Breaks down gun violence by magnitude, age group, and intentions
- Provides specific statistics by state, date, and city
- This dataset is owned by the Gun Violence Archive and can be accessed in its original form here.

[England/Wales Gun Violence Data set](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7654/)

- Isolates gun violence by number of offenses, lethality, and type of crime
- Provides statistics by region, date, and city
- This data set was produced by UK Parliament, House of Commons Library

### Visualizations
The data sets have date/time and spatial data that can be used as comparative components to provide definitive answers to differences in gun-related incidents. The spatial data can be best explored by using map elements to track the concentration of gun violence incidents across both countries. To supplement the mapping graphics we would apply a comparative element to show the magnitude of incidents during election years and off years. In terms of design, a heat map or Kepler map would be visually inviting to show concentration. The relationship of location to the incident can be used to explain other inquiries or correlations as to why there is a higher concentration. It is also essential to analyze the types of gun violence and their relationship to election years. A pie chart could be beneficial to show the different kinds of gun violence and their measure per year. Additionally, tracking trends over the span of multiple years and comparing those trends to different candidates moving in and out of office will produce data to relate back to social media platforms’ sentiments. A two-category histogram can also be used to compare the span of political events, over time, in England and the US, in which the width would vary according to gun violence magnitude. Overall the visualizations would illustrate trends in gun-related incidents over the span of the political calendars in England and the US.


## Conclusion
The insights we hope to gain from this research project is a better understanding of the appearance of election associated gun violence in and outside of the US, specifically the UK, and how varying gun restrictions by country affect the outcome. Looking at sentiments, like nationalism, and their association with gun related incidents will help us better understand why the trends change over time. Overall, understanding the nature of trends associated with gun related incidents will help us and others navigate possibilities of prevention and like solutions.
